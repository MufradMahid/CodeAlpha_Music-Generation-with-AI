# CodeAlpha_Music-Generation-with-AI
Developed an AI-based music generation system using Python and LSTM neural networks. The model learns patterns from MIDI files and generates new musical compositions automatically. This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can create creative audio content.


# Music Generation with AI – CodeAlpha Internship (TASK 3)

This project generates new music using AI techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- music21
- LSTM Neural Network

## How It Works
1. MIDI music files are collected
2. Notes are extracted and converted into sequences
3. An LSTM model learns music patterns
4. New music is generated and saved as a MIDI file

## Output
- generated_music.mid

## Output
The model generates a MIDI music file (`generated_music.mid`).
The file can be played using Windows Media Player or any MIDI-compatible player.
